## Introduction
Gratuity is a cash benefit provided by an employer to an employee for the services rendered to the organization. It is paid at the time of retirement, resignation, layoff or termination, provided the employee has completed five years of continuous services before leaving the organization. In certain cases, such as death or disablement, the rule of continuous 5 year service is relaxed.

### What is Gratuity Calculator
You can use the gratuity calculator to estimate the amount of money you will receive if you are planning to leave a job after a minimum of five years of services or looking forward to your retirement. There are various rules for gratuity calculation that you should keep in mind beforehand.

### Gratuity Calculations Formula
The gratuity rules and calculation are prescribed by the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. There are mainly two categories of calculations determined, as detailed below:
#### Category 1: Employees covered under the Act
#### Category 2: Employees not covered under the Act

These two categories cover both private as well as government employees. For government employees, there are more heads to be accounted for which are specific to their pay structure, such as, Dearness Allowance. All organizations with at least ten employees working on a single day for the preceding 12 months are required to pay gratuity.

1. Category 1: Employees covered under the Act 

> Using the two important parameters - number of years of service and last salary drawn, you can calculate the gratuity as follows - 
> ### ` Gratuity = Last drawn salary x (15/26) x Number of years of service `
> the number of working days per month is taken as 26 days
> gratuity calculation is done at the rate of 15 days wages
> Last drawn salary should be carefully calculated to account for the following components -
> * Basic
> * Deamess Allowance - for govemment employees
> * Commission received on sales

Example if you had been drawing Rs 80,000 as your last basic salary with 10 years 4 months of employment tenor then the gratuity amount you will receive as per the formula is

Gratuity = Rs 80,000 x (15/26) x 10 = Rs 4.62 lakhs

The 4 months is less than 5, so is rounded of to 10. Months more than 5 are rounded off to the next year.

2. Category 2: Employees not covered under the Act

> You can be paid a gratuity even if the organization is not covered under the Act. If that is the case. the number of working days in a month changes to 30 days instead of 26 days
> ### ` Gratuity = Last drawn salary x (15/30) x Number of years of service `
> In the above example, it your organization is not covered under the Act, then the calculation will be as follows
> 
> Gratuity = Rs 80,000 x (15/30) x 10 = 4.00 lakhs

For employees covered under the Act, the benefit of a lower denomination is given. Hence working days in a month are taken as 26 days instead of 30 days
